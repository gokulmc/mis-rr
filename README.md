**Project Title: Experimental Evaluation of Multi-Installment Scheduling Strategy for SAR Image Reconstruction**

_**Overview**_
This project focuses on the experimental evaluation of a multi-installment scheduling strategy based on the divisible load paradigm for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image reconstruction. The goal is to assess the performance of the Multi-Installment Scheduling with Result Retrieval (MIS-RR) strategy in comparison to the traditional EQual-partitioning Strategy (EQS) in terms of time performance, cost, and utilization of the compute infrastructure.
